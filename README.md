# GitHub Action for Dispatching Workflows

# Acknowledgements

This GitHub Action is a fork of [`codex-/return-dispatch`](https://github.com/Codex-/return-dispatch). This action supported the ability to extract a Run ID, but exclusively supported the `workflow_dispatch` method. I decided to fork this action as it had an intuitive code-base and excellent testing philosophy.

From a **compatibility** and **performance** perspective, this GitHub Action superseedes [`codex-/return-dispatch`](https://github.com/Codex-/return-dispatch), as it additionally supports the `repository_dispatch` method and uses a more efficient algorithm to extract the Run ID from a dispatched workflow
